# Decentralized File Sharing

## Overview
This project aims to create a decentralized file sharing system that allows users to share files peer-to-peer, without relying on a central server or authority. The system utilizes blockchain technology and a distributed network to ensure secure and efficient file sharing.

## Features
- Peer-to-peer file sharing: Users can directly share files with each other without intermediaries.
- Blockchain-based authentication: Users are authenticated using blockchain technology, ensuring trust and security.
- Distributed network: The system utilizes a distributed network of nodes, eliminating the need for a central server.
- Secure file transfer: Files are encrypted and transferred securely between peers.
- Data integrity: Blockchain ensures the integrity of shared files, preventing unauthorized modifications.
- Decentralized search: Users can search for files across the network without relying on a central index.
